# Banking-Financial-Analysis
This project takes budget data from a bank in the form of a .csv. Then, uses a Python script to calculate total number of months included in the dataset, total net profit/loss over the period, average change in profit/loss between the months, greatest increase in profits, and the greatest increase in loss over the period. This information is then output to the terminal and a text file.
